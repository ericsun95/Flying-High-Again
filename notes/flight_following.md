# Flight following

Radar traffic information service — commonly known as VFR flight following — is a service provided by air traffic control (ATC) and available to all VFR pilots which can enhance your flying safety. While receiving flight following, you’ll bein radio contact with a radar controller at a Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) orAir Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC).


Sample Talk:

Input: ALBUQUERQUE CENTER, CHEROKEE 321SH.

Output: CHEROKEE 321SH GO AHEAD.

Input: CHEROKEE 1SH IS A PA28/U, FIVE MILES SOUTH OF ELOY AIRPORT, 5500 FEET, VFR TO TUCSON INTERNATIONAL, REQUEST FLIGHT FOLLOWING.


ATC will then issue you a **transponder code**, **radar** identify you, and give you the nearest current **altimeter** setting. From that point onward you’re receiving traffic advisories and you’ll be handed off to other ATC sectors as you pass through them during your flight.

CHEROKEE 1SH, RADAR SERVICE TERMINATED, SQUAWK 1200, FOR FURTHER FLIGHT FOLLOWING TRY LOS ANGELES CENTER ON 125.3.

## Handoffs

It’s a good idea to keep a"frequency log." Simply write down the frequency every time you’re issued a new one.
