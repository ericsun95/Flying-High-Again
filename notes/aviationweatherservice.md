## Observations

The data gathered from surface and upper altitude observations form the basis of all weather forecasts,
advisories, and briefings.

Four types:
- surface
- upper air
- radar
- satellite

### Surface Aviation Weather Observations (METARs)

- Automated weather sources, such as the Automated Weather Observing Systems (AWOS)
- Automated Surface Observing Systems (ASOS)
- The Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) facilities
  are responsible for maintaining separation between flights
  conducted under instrument flight rules (IFR) in the en
  route structure.

### Upper Air Observations

There are several methods by which upper air weather phenomena can be observed:
radiosonde observations, pilot weather reports (PIREPs),
Aircraft Meteorological Data Relay (AMDAR) and the
Meteorological Data Collection and Reporting System
(MDCRS)

The Aircraft Meteorological Data Relay (AMDAR) is
an international program utilizing commercial aircraft to
provide automated weather observations.
### Radar Observations
### Satellite

## Service Outlets
Service outlets are government, government contract, or
private facilities that provide aviation weather services. Several government agencies, including the FAA, National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the
NWS work in conjunction with private aviation companies
to provide different means of accessing weather information.

### Flight Service Station (FSS)
The FSS is the primary source for preflight weather
information. A preflight weather briefing from an FSS can be
obtained 24 hours a day by calling 1-800-WX BRIEF from
anywhere in the United States and Puerto Rico.

### Telephone Information Briefing Service (TIBS)
The Telephone Information Briefing Service (TIBS),
provided by FSS, is a system of automated telephone
recordings of meteorological and aeronautical information.

### Hazardous Inflight Weather Advisory Service (HIWAS)
Hazardous Inflight Weather Advisory Service (HIWAS),
available in the 48 conterminous states, is an automated
continuous broadcast of hazardous weather information
over selected VOR navigational aids (NAVAIDs).
The broadcasts include advisories such as AIRMETS, SIGMETS,
convective SIGMETS, and urgent PIREPs.

### Transcribed Weather Broadcast (TWEB) (Alaska Only) 
A continuous automated broadcast of meteorological and
aeronautical data over selected low or medium frequency (L/
MF) and very high frequency (VHF) omnidirectional range
(VOR) NAVAID facilities. The broadcasts are automatically
updated as changes occur. 


## Weather Briefings
Prior to every flight, pilots should gather all information
vital to the nature of the flight. This includes an appropriate
weather briefing obtained from a specialist at a FSS.

For weather specialists to provide an appropriate weather
briefing, they need to know which of the three types of
briefings is needed—standard, abbreviated, or outlook.

### Standard Briefing

A standard briefing provides the most complete information
and a more complete weather picture. This type of briefing
should be obtained prior to the departure of any flight and
should be used during flight planning.

- Adverse conditions
- VFR flight not recommended
- Synopsis
- Current conditions
- En route forecast
- Destination forecast
- Forecast winds and temperatures aloft
- Notices to Airmen (NOTAM)
- ATC delays
- Other information

### Abbreviated Briefing
An abbreviated briefing is a shortened version of the standard
briefing. It should be requested when a departure has been
delayed or when weather information is needed to update
the previous briefing.

### Outlook Briefing
An outlook briefing should be requested when a planned
departure is 6 hours or more away. It provides initial forecast
information that is limited in scope due to the time frame
of the planned flight.


## Aviation Weather Reports

Aviation weather reports are designed to give accurate
depictions of current weather conditions. Each report
provides current information that is updated at different times.
Some typical reports are METARs and PIREPs.

### Aviation Routine Weather Report (METAR)
A METAR is an observation of current surface weather
reported in a standard international format.

### Pilot Weather Reports (PIREPs)
PIREPs provide valuable information regarding the
conditions as they actually exist in the air, which cannot be
gathered from any other source.

## Aviation Forecast
Observed weather condition reports are often used in the
creation of forecasts for the same area. A variety of different
forecast products are produced and designed to be used in the
preflight planning stage. The printed forecasts that pilots need
to be familiar with are the terminal aerodrome forecast (TAF),
aviation area forecast (FA), inflight weather advisories
(SIGMET, AIRMET), and the winds and temperatures aloft
forecast (FB).

### Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts (TAF)
A TAF is a report established for the five statute mile
radius around an airport. Each TAF is valid for a 24 or 30-hour time
period and is updated four times a day at 0000Z, 0600Z,
1200Z, and 1800Z. The TAF utilizes the same descriptors
and abbreviations as used in the METAR report.

### Area Forecasts
The FA gives a picture of clouds, general weather conditions,
and visual meteorological conditions (VMC) expected over
a large area encompassing several states.

### Inflight Weather Advisories
Inflight weather advisories, which are provided to en route
aircraft, are forecasts that detail potentially hazardous
weather. These advisories are also available to pilots prior
to departure for flight planning purposes. An inflight
weather advisory is issued in the form of either an AIRMET,
SIGMET, or convective SIGMET.

#### AIRMET
AIRMETs (WAs) are examples of inflight weather advisories
that are issued every 6 hours with intermediate updates
issued as needed for a particular area forecast region. 

**An AIRMET includes forecast of moderate icing, moderate
turbulence, sustained surface winds of 30 knots or
greater, widespread areas of ceilings less than 1,000 feet
and/or visibilities less than three miles, and extensive
mountain obscurement.**

Each AIRMET bulletin has a fixed alphanumeric designator,
numbered sequentially for easy identification, beginning with
the first issuance of the day. Sierra is the AIRMET code used
to denote IFR and mountain obscuration; Tango is used to
denote turbulence, strong surface winds, and low-level wind
shear; and Zulu is used to denote icing and freezing levels.


#### SIGMET
SIGMETs (WSs) are inflight advisories concerning nonconvective weather that is potentially hazardous to all
aircraft. They report weather forecasts that include severe
icing not associated with thunderstorms, severe or extreme
turbulence or clear air turbulence (CAT) not associated with
thunderstorms, dust storms or sandstorms that lower surface
or inflight visibilities to below three miles, and volcanic ash.
SIGMETs are unscheduled forecasts that are valid for 4 hours
unless the SIGMET relates to a hurricane, in which case it
is valid for 6 hours.

A SIGMET is issued under an alphabetic identifier, from
November through Yankee. The first issuance of a SIGMET
is designated as an Urgent Weather SIGMET (UWS).
Reissued SIGMETs for the same weather phenomenon are
sequentially numbered until the weather phenomenon ends.

#### Convective Significant Meteorological Information (WST)
A Convective SIGMET (WST) is an inflight weather
advisory issued for hazardous convective weather that affects
the safety of every flight. Convective SIGMETs are issued
for severe thunderstorms with surface winds greater than 50
knots, hail at the surface greater than or equal to ¾ inch in
diameter, or tornadoes. They are also issued to advise pilots
of embedded thunderstorms, lines of thunderstorms, or
thunderstorms with heavy or greater precipitation that affect
40 percent or more of a 3,000 square mile or greater region.


#### Winds and Temperature Aloft Forecast (FB)
Winds and temperatures aloft forecasts (FB) provide wind
and temperature forecasts for specific locations throughout
the United States, including network locations in Hawaii
and Alaska. The forecasts are made twice a day based on the
radiosonde upper air observations taken at 0000Z and 1200Z.

Altitudes through 12,000 feet are classified as true altitudes,
while altitudes 18,000 feet and above are classified as
altitudes and are termed flight levels. Wind direction is
always in reference to true north, and wind speed is given in
knots. The temperature is given in degrees Celsius. No winds
are forecast when a given level is within 1,500 feet of the
station elevation. Similarly, temperatures are not forecast for
any station within 2,500 feet of the station elevation.

### Weather Charts
Weather charts are graphic charts that depict current or
forecast weather. They provide an overall picture of the
United States and should be used in the beginning stages of
flight planning. Typically, weather charts show the movement
of major weather systems and fronts. Surface analysis,
weather depiction, and significant weather prognostic charts
are sources of current weather information. Significant
weather prognostic charts provide an overall forecast weather
picture.

#### Surface Analysis Chart
The surface analysis chart depicts an analysis of the current
surface weather.

![stationmodelweatherchart](/materials/figures/stationmodelweatherchart.png)


#### Weather Depiction Chart
A weather depiction chart details surface conditions as
derived from METAR and other surface observations. The
weather depiction chart is prepared and transmitted by
computer every 3 hours beginning at 0100Z time and is valid
data for the forecast period.

The weather depiction chart also provides a graphic display
of IFR, VFR, and marginal VFR (MVFR) weather.


The weather depiction chart also provides a graphic display
of IFR, VFR, and marginal VFR (MVFR) weather. Areas of
IFR conditions (ceilings less than 1,000 feet and visibility
less than three miles) are shown by a hatched area outlined
by a smooth line. MVFR regions (ceilings 1,000 to 3,000
feet, visibility 3 to 5 miles) are shown by a nonhatched area
outlined by a smooth line. Areas of VFR (no ceiling or ceiling
greater than 3,000 feet and visibility greater than five miles)
are not outlined. Also plotted are fronts, troughs, and squall
lines from the previous hours surface analysis chart.

Weather depiction charts show a modified station model
that provides sky conditions in the form of total sky cover,
ceiling height, weather, and obstructions to visibility, but
does not include winds or pressure readings like the surface
analysis chart.

#### Significant Weather Prognostic Charts
Significant weather prognostic charts are available for lowlevel significant weather from the surface to FL 240 (24,000
feet), also referred to as the 400 mb level and high-level
significant weather from FL 250 to FL 630 (25,000 to 63,000
feet). The primary concern of this discussion is the low-level
significant weather prognostic chart.

### ATC Radar Weather Displays
ARTCC facilities normally use a Weather and Radar
Processor (WARP) to display a mosaic of data obtained
from multiple NEXRAD sites.

### Electronic Flight Displays (EFD) /MultiFunction Display (MFD) Weather
Many aircraft manufacturers now include data link weather
services with new electronic flight display (EFD) systems.
EFDs give a pilot access to many of the data link weather
services available.
