# Aviation weather


## Thunderstorm formation
- Sufficient water vapor (commonly measured using dewpoint)
- Unstable air
- lifting mechanism
  - converging winds around surface lows
  - troughs, fronts, upslope flow, drylines, outflow boundaries generated by prior storms
  - local winds, such as sea breeze, lake breeze, land breeze, and valley breeze circulations

## Thunderstorm cell lifecycle
- Towering cumulus (strong convective draft)
- Mature
- Dissipating
The total lifecycle is typically about 30 mins.

**The cell transitions to the mature stage when precipitation reaches the surface**.

Precipitation descends through the cloud and drags the adjacent air downward, creating
a strong downdraft alongside the updraft. The downdraft spreads out along the surface,
well in advance of the parent thunderstorm cell, as a mass of cool, gusty air.
The arc-shaped leading edge of downdraft air resembles a miniature cold front and
is called a gust front. Uplift along the gust front may trigger the formation of new cells, sometimes well ahead of the parent cell. Cumulonimbus tops frequently penetrate into the lower stratosphere as an overshooting top, where strong winds aloft distort the cloud top into an anvil shape. Weather hazards reach peak intensity toward the end of the mature
stage.

The dissipating stage is marked by a strong downdraft embedded within the area
of precipitation. Subsiding air replaces the updraft throughout the cloud, effectively
cutting off the supply of moisture provided by the updraft. Precipitation tapers off and
ends. Compression warms the subsiding air and the relative humidity drops.
The convective cloud gradually vaporizes from below, leaving only a remnant anvil
cloud.

## Thunder Types
- Single cell
- Multicell (cluster and line)
- supercell

Sometimes thunderstorms will form in a line that can extend laterally for hundreds
of miles. New cells continually re-form at the leading edge of the system with rain, and sometimes hail, following behind. Sometimes storms which comprise the line can
be supercells. The line can persist for many hours (or more) as long as the three necessary ingredients continue to exist. These squall lines are the thunderstorm type which presents the most effective barrier to air traffic because the line is usually too tall to fly over, too dangerous to fly through or under, and difficult to circumnavigate. About 25 percent of all U.S. tornadoes are spawned by squall lines.

For supercell thunderstorm, Updraft speeds may reach
9,000 feet per minute (100 knots).

## Hazards
A thunderstorm can pack just about every aviation weather hazard into one
vicious bundle. These hazards include: lightning, adverse winds, downbursts, turbulence,
icing, hail, rapid altimeter changes, static electricity, and tornadoes.
