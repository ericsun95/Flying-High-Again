# Aviation weather

## Cloud
A "ceiling" is the lowest cloud layer that covers most of the sky.  
If it is solid, it 's called "overcast." A "broken" ceiling is simply an overcast with a few holes in it.


## Thunderstorm formation
- Sufficient water vapor (commonly measured using dewpoint)
- Unstable air
- lifting mechanism
  - converging winds around surface lows
  - troughs, fronts, upslope flow, drylines, outflow boundaries generated by prior storms
  - local winds, such as sea breeze, lake breeze, land breeze, and valley breeze circulations

## Thunderstorm cell lifecycle
- Towering cumulus (strong convective draft)
- Mature
- Dissipating
The total lifecycle is typically about 30 mins.

**The cell transitions to the mature stage when precipitation reaches the surface**.

The mature stage of a thunderstorm is signaled by the formation of downdrafts which allows precipitation to fall.


Precipitation descends through the cloud and drags the adjacent air downward, creating
a strong downdraft alongside the updraft. The downdraft spreads out along the surface,
well in advance of the parent thunderstorm cell, as a mass of cool, gusty air.
The arc-shaped leading edge of downdraft air resembles a miniature cold front and
is called a gust front. Uplift along the gust front may trigger the formation of new cells, sometimes well ahead of the parent cell. Cumulonimbus tops frequently penetrate into the lower stratosphere as an overshooting top, where strong winds aloft distort the cloud top into an anvil shape. Weather hazards reach peak intensity toward the end of the mature
stage.

The dissipating stage is marked by a strong downdraft embedded within the area
of precipitation. Subsiding air replaces the updraft throughout the cloud, effectively
cutting off the supply of moisture provided by the updraft. Precipitation tapers off and
ends. Compression warms the subsiding air and the relative humidity drops.
The convective cloud gradually vaporizes from below, leaving only a remnant anvil
cloud.

## Thunder Types
- Single cell
- Multicell (cluster and line)
- supercell

Sometimes thunderstorms will form in a line that can extend laterally for hundreds
of miles. New cells continually re-form at the leading edge of the system with rain, and sometimes hail, following behind. Sometimes storms which comprise the line can
be supercells. The line can persist for many hours (or more) as long as the three necessary ingredients continue to exist. These squall lines are the thunderstorm type which presents the most effective barrier to air traffic because the line is usually too tall to fly over, too dangerous to fly through or under, and difficult to circumnavigate. About 25 percent of all U.S. tornadoes are spawned by squall lines.

For supercell thunderstorm, Updraft speeds may reach
9,000 feet per minute (100 knots).

## Hazards
A thunderstorm can pack just about every aviation weather hazard into one
vicious bundle. These hazards include: lightning, adverse winds, downbursts, turbulence,
icing, hail, rapid altimeter changes, static electricity, and tornadoes.



> A nonfrontal, narrow band of active thunderstorms that often develop ahead of a cold front is a known as a squall line.
A squall line is defined as a non-frontal narrow band of active thunderstorms.


## Fog And Frost

- Advection fog:
An air mass moving inland from the coast in winter.
Advection fog forms when moist air moves over colder ground or water. 平流雾）

- Steam fog: A light breeze blowing colder air out to sea, Low-level turbulence can occur and icing can become hazardous. (海烟)

- Upslope fog: A warm, moist air mass on the windward side of mountains.

- Inland fog is most likely: Radiation Fog sometimes called ground fog.
  Radiation fog is a common type of fog, produced over a land area when radiational cooling reduces the air temperature to or below its dew point. 
  Ground fog is a form of radiation fog that is confined to near ground level. 

Below rotor clouds.
Under each wave crest there is a rotary circulation. It forms below the elevation of the mountain peaks. Turbulence can be violent in the overturning rotor. The rotor may be marked by a rotor cloud. Turbulence is most severe in and below the standing rotors.


- The standard temperature lapse rate is:
- 2°C per 1,000 feet.
A standard temperature lapse rate is one in which the temperature decreases at the rate of approximately 3.5 °F or 2 °C per 1000' up to about 36,000'.


The temperature of the collecting surface is at or below the dewpoint of the adjacent air and the dewpoint is below freezing.
Frost forms in much the same way as dew. The difference is that the collecting surface must be colder than the dew point of the surrounding air and the dew point must be colder than freezing.
