# Aviation weather

Weather is an important factor that influences aircraft
performance and flying safety. It is the state of the atmosphere
at a given time and place with respect to variables, such as
temperature (heat or cold), moisture (wetness or dryness),
wind velocity (calm or storm), visibility (clearness or
cloudiness), and barometric pressure (high or low). The
term “weather” can also apply to adverse or destructive
atmospheric conditions, such as high winds.

Inside the troposphere, the average
temperature decreases at a rate of about 2 °Celsius (C) every
1,000 feet of altitude gain, and the pressure decreases at a rate
of about one inch per 1,000 feet of altitude gain.

Standard sea level pressure
is defined as 29.92 "Hg and a standard temperature of 59 °F
(15 °C).

- troposphere (20000 feet)
- stratosphere (160000 feet)
- mesosphere (280000 feet)
- thermosphere

The force created by the rotation of the Earth is known as
the Coriolis force.

The combination of atmospheric pressure differences, **Coriolis
force**, **friction**, and **temperature** differences of the air near
the earth cause two kinds of atmospheric motion: **convective
currents (upward and downward motion)** and **wind
(horizontal motion)**.

## Wind
- sea breeze: onshore wind
- land breeze: offshore wind

Wind conditions are reported by an arrow attached to the
station location circle. ![windchart](/materials/figures/windchart.png) The station circle
represents the head of the arrow, with the arrow pointing
in the direction from which the wind is blowing. Winds
are described by the direction from which they blow, thus
a northwest wind means that the wind is blowing from the
northwest toward the southeast. The speed of the wind is
depicted by barbs or pennants placed on the wind line. Each
barb represents a speed of ten knots, while half a barb is equal
to five knots, and a pennant is equal to 50 knots.

### Low-Level Wind Shear
Wind shear is a sudden, drastic change in wind speed and/or
direction over a very small area. Wind shear can subject an
aircraft to violent updrafts and downdrafts, as well as abrupt
changes to the horizontal movement of the aircraft.

The most severe type of low-level wind shear, a microburst
is associated with convective precipitation into dry air at
cloud base.

### Microburst

Microburst activity may be indicated by an
intense rain shaft at the surface but virga at cloud base
and a ring of blowing dust is often the only visible clue.
A typical microburst has a horizontal diameter of 1–2
miles and a nominal depth of 1,000 feet. The lifespan of a
microburst is about 5–15 minutes during which time it can
produce downdrafts of up to 6,000 feet per minute (fpm)
and headwind losses of 30–90 knots, seriously degrading
performance. It can also produce strong turbulence and
hazardous wind direction changes.

### Adiabatic Process
- adiabatic heating
- adiabatic cooling

The adiabatic process takes place in all upward and
downward moving air. When air rises into an area of lower
pressure, it expands to a larger volume. As the molecules
of air expand, the temperature of the air lowers. As a result,
when a parcel of air rises, pressure decreases, volume
increases, and temperature decreases. When air descends,
the opposite is true. The rate at which temperature decreases
with an increase in altitude is referred to as its lapse rate.
As air ascends through the atmosphere, the average rate of
temperature change is 2 °C (3.5 °F) per 1,000 feet.

### Inversion
When the temperature of the air rises with altitude, a temperature
inversion exists. Inversion layers are commonly shallow layers
of smooth, stable air close to the ground.

### Water 

- liquid, solid, gaseous
- changes: evaporation, sublimation, condensation, deposition, melting or freezing

### Relative Humidity
- Humidity refers to the amount of water vapor present in the atmosphere at a given time
- Relative humidity is the actual amount of moisture in the air compared to the total amount 
of moisture the air could hold at that temperature.
- The dew point, given in degrees, is the temperature at which the air can hold no more moisture.
  - When the temperature of the air is reduced to the dew point, the air is completely saturated and moisture begins to 
  condense out of the air in the form of fog, dew, frost, clouds, rain or snow

## Cloud
For cloud to form, there must be adequate water vapor and condensation nuclei, as well as a method by which
the air can be cooled. When the air cools and reaches its saturation point, the invisible water vapor changes
into a visible state.

A "ceiling" is the lowest cloud layer that covers most of the sky.  
If it is solid, it 's called "overcast." A "broken" ceiling is simply an overcast with a few holes in it.

### Temperature Inversion
If rain falls through a temperature inversion, it may freeze as it passes through the underlying cold air
and fall to the ground in the form of ice pellets. Ice pellets are an indication of a temperature inversion
and that freezing rain exists at a higher altitude. In the case of hail, freezing water droplets are carried
up and down by drafts inside cumulonimbus clouds, growing larger as they come in contact with more
moisture.

### Snow
Snow is precipitation in the form of ice crystals that falls at a steady rate or in snow showers that begin,
change in intensity, and end rapidly.

### Fronts
The boundary layer between two types of air masses is known as a front. There are 4 types:
- Warm
- Cold
- Stationary
- Occluded (An occluded front occurs when a fast moving cold front catches up with a slow moving warm front)

![fronts](/materials/figures/fronts.png)
![warmfronts](/materials/figures/warmfronts.png)

Whereas warm fronts bring low ceilings, poor visibility, and rain, cold fronts bring sudden storms,
gusty winds, turbulence, and sometimes hail or tornadoes.

## Thunderstorm formation
- Sufficient water vapor (commonly measured using dewpoint)
- Unstable air (unstable lapse rate)
- lifting mechanism
  - converging winds around surface lows
  - troughs, fronts, upslope flow, drylines, outflow boundaries generated by prior storms
  - local winds, such as sea breeze, lake breeze, land breeze, and valley breeze circulations

## Thunderstorm cell lifecycle
- Towering cumulus (strong convective draft)
- Mature
- Dissipating (Once the vertical motion near the top of the cloud slows down, the top of the cloud spreads out and takes
  on an anvil-like shape. At this point, the storm enters the dissipating stage. This is when the downdrafts spread out and
  replace the updrafts needed to sustain the storm)

A good rule of thumb is to circumnavigate thunderstorms identified as severe or giving an extreme radar echo by
at least 20 nautical miles (NM) since hail may fall for miles outside the clouds.

The total lifecycle is typically about 30 mins.

**The cell transitions to the mature stage when precipitation reaches the surface**.

The mature stage of a thunderstorm is signaled by the formation of downdrafts which allows precipitation to fall.


Precipitation descends through the cloud and drags the adjacent air downward, creating
a strong downdraft alongside the updraft. The downdraft spreads out along the surface,
well in advance of the parent thunderstorm cell, as a mass of cool, gusty air.
The arc-shaped leading edge of downdraft air resembles a miniature cold front and
is called a gust front. Uplift along the gust front may trigger the formation of new cells, sometimes well ahead of the parent cell. Cumulonimbus tops frequently penetrate into the lower stratosphere as an overshooting top, where strong winds aloft distort the cloud top into an anvil shape. Weather hazards reach peak intensity toward the end of the mature
stage.

The dissipating stage is marked by a strong downdraft embedded within the area
of precipitation. Subsiding air replaces the updraft throughout the cloud, effectively
cutting off the supply of moisture provided by the updraft. Precipitation tapers off and
ends. Compression warms the subsiding air and the relative humidity drops.
The convective cloud gradually vaporizes from below, leaving only a remnant anvil
cloud.

### Squall line
A squall line is a narrow band of active thunderstorms.

### Thunder Types
- Single cell
- Multicell (cluster and line)
- supercell

Sometimes thunderstorms will form in a line that can extend laterally for hundreds
of miles. New cells continually re-form at the leading edge of the system with rain, and sometimes hail, following behind. Sometimes storms which comprise the line can
be supercells. The line can persist for many hours (or more) as long as the three necessary ingredients continue to exist. These squall lines are the thunderstorm type which presents the most effective barrier to air traffic because the line is usually too tall to fly over, too dangerous to fly through or under, and difficult to circumnavigate. About 25 percent of all U.S. tornadoes are spawned by squall lines.

For supercell thunderstorm, Updraft speeds may reach
9,000 feet per minute (100 knots).

## Hazards
A thunderstorm can pack just about every aviation weather hazard into one
vicious bundle. These hazards include: lightning, adverse winds, downbursts, turbulence,
icing, hail, rapid altimeter changes, static electricity, and tornadoes.



> A nonfrontal, narrow band of active thunderstorms that often develop ahead of a cold front is a known as a squall line.
> A squall line is defined as a non-frontal narrow band of active thunderstorms.


## Fog And Frost

- Advection fog: An air mass moving inland from the coast in winter. 
  Advection fog forms when moist air moves over colder ground or water. 平流雾）
- Radiation fog: it forms in the evening when heat absorbed by the Earth's surface during the day is radiated into the air.
- Steam fog: A light breeze blowing colder air out to sea, Low-level turbulence can occur and icing can become hazardous. (海烟)
- Upslope fog: A warm, moist air mass on the windward side of mountains.
- Inland fog is most likely: Radiation Fog sometimes called ground fog.
  Radiation fog is a common type of fog, produced over a land area when radiational cooling reduces the air temperature to or below its dew point. 
  Ground fog is a form of radiation fog that is confined to near ground level. 

Below rotor clouds.
Under each wave crest there is a rotary circulation. It forms below the elevation of the mountain peaks. Turbulence can be violent in the overturning rotor. The rotor may be marked by a rotor cloud. Turbulence is most severe in and below the standing rotors.


- The standard temperature lapse rate is:
- 2°C per 1,000 feet.
A standard temperature lapse rate is one in which the temperature decreases at the rate of approximately 3.5 °F or 2 °C per 1000' up to about 36,000'.


The temperature of the collecting surface is at or below the dewpoint of the adjacent air and the dewpoint is below freezing.
Frost forms in much the same way as dew. The difference is that the collecting surface must be colder than the dew point of the surrounding air and the dew point must be colder than freezing.



## Weather Forecast

- AIRMETs are issued for moderate icing conditions.
- SIGMET.
  The SIGMET contains severe weather for all aircraft including severe icing.
- Convective SIGMET.
  A Convective SIGMET implies severe or greater turbulence, severe icing, and low-level wind shear. These are only issued for severe thunderstorms, embedded thunderstorms, lines of thunderstorms, and thunderstorms with wide spread heavy precipitation.
