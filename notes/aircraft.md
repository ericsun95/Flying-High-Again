# Aircraft

## Engine System

Engine start process: warm vs cold weather


### Rudder
Counteract the adverse yaw.
- Adverse Yaw: the airplane will initially yaw in the opposite direction of the bank

### Elevator Trim
Controlled by a trim wheel in the cockpit.

### Flap
Landing approach to be steeper and slower


## Category vs Class

*Category:*

(1) As used with respect to the certification, ratings, privileges, and limitations of airmen, means a broad classification of aircraft. Examples include: airplane; rotorcraft; glider; and lighter-than-air; and
(2) As used with respect to the certification of aircraft, means a grouping of aircraft based upon intended use or operating limitations. Examples include: transport, normal, utility, acrobatic, limited, restricted, and provisional.



*Class:*

(1) As used with respect to the certification, ratings, privileges, and limitations of airmen, means a classification of aircraft within a category having similar operating characteristics. Examples include: single engine; multiengine; land; water; gyroplane; helicopter; airship; and free balloon; and
(2) As used with respect to the certification of aircraft, means a broad grouping of aircraft having similar characteristics of propulsion, flight, or landing. Examples include: airplane; rotorcraft; glider; balloon; landplane; and seaplane.


- High Performance Airplane: Contains a piston engine rated over 200 horsepower (Cessna 182, Cirrus SR-22 and Beech Bonanza)
- Complex Airplane: includes a controllable-pitch propeller, retractable landing gear and wind flaps (Cessna 172RG, Piper Arrow, Beech Bonanza, Piper Malibu)
- Technically Advanced Aircraft (TAA): Cockpit features a PFD, MFD and Two-Axis Autopilot


## Airspeed
- $S_0$: stalling speed or minimum steady flight speed in the landing configuration.
- $V_{NO}$: Upper limit of green arc (VNO)â€”the maximum structural cruising speed. Do not exceed this speed except in smooth air.
- $V_{NE}$: the never-exceed speed.
- $V_A$: VA means design maneuvering speed.
- $V_{S1}$: means the stalling speed or the minimum steady flight speed obtained in a specific configuration.
- $V_{FE}$: VFE means maximum flap extended speed.
- $V_{FC}$: VFC/MFC means maximum speed for stability characteristics.
- $V_{LOF}$: VLOF means lift-off speed.
