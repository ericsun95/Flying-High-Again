Engine start process: warm vs cold weather

## Flight Instrument
Six Packs:
- Airspeed Indicator (nautical miles per hour (knots))
- Attitude Indicator
  - displays pitch and bank information relative to the natural horizon
- Altimeter 
  - measure the altitude of the airplane above sea level (MSL)
  - longest 100, shorter, 1000, diamond hand 10000
  - based on barometric pressure
- Turn Coordinator
  - Standard Rate Turn (3 degree per second)
  - Inclinometer (Quality of the Turn (Skip/Skid))
- Heading Indicator
  - Not affected by errors caused by bank, pitch or speed changes
- Vertical Speed Indicator

The gyroscopes in the attitude indicator and the heading indicator are usually driven by air pressure.


Others:
- Magnetic Compass: Mechanical instrument which automatically orients to magnetic north
- Tachometer: Displays the engine RPM (primary indicator of power)
- Oil Pressure & Temperature
- Fuel Flow Gauge
- Exhaust gas temperature (help with the mixture)
- Electric items (protected by the circuit breakers)
- Trim Indicator (node up/down)
- Vacuum Gauge: Check the operation of the two engine driven vacuum pumps
- Fuel selector
- Voltmeter
- Time


Measurement
- Nautical Mile (NM) 1 == 6076.1 Feet
- STATUTE Mile (SM) 1 == 5280 Feet
- 1 NM = 1.15 SM

### Engine
- Four Stroke, internal combustion, reciprocating engines

There are six basic parts of an airplane’s engine – cylinders, pistons which are inside the cylinders, valves at the top of each cylinder, connecting rods linking the piston to the crankshaft, and the crankcase, which is the metal engine frame.
Each cylinder has two spark plugs for improved combustion and as a safety backup.

There are five events that occur in the cycle of a four-stroke engine:
- During the intake stroke, the piston is moving in toward the crankshaft and the intake valve is open, allowing the fuel air mixture to flow into the cylinder.
- As the piston starts moving out, away from the crankshaft, both valves are closed and the fuel/air mixture is compressed in the cylinder. This stroke is called the compression stroke.
- As the piston nears the end of its outward travel, the fuel air mixture is ignited and the rapid burning and expansion of the fuel pushes the piston toward the crankshaft in the power stroke.
- During the exhaust stroke, the last stroke in the cycle, the piston moves out and the exhaust valve is opened and the burned gasses are forced out of the cylinder.
- As a cylinder is undergoing this cycle, the other cylinders are each going through different parts of the cycle. No matter how many cylinders an engine has, each of the cylinders will complete the cycle every time the crankshaft makes two revolutions.

- In burning the fuel/air mixture, heat is produced, most of which is evacuated through the exhaust system.
Most airplane engines are air cooled. Baffles guide the airflow to the heat critical parts of the engine. The cylinders have cooling fins which increase the effectiveness of the air flow. The air enters the front of the engine compartment, passes over the baffled fins, and exits through the rear of the engine cowling.
Engine lubricating oil performs three functions – it coats the surfaces of all moving parts with a slick film, it dissipates heat as it circulates through the oil cooler, and third, it carries any foreign materials to the oil filter.
Airplane engines have a two magneto ignition system. The magnetos power the spark plugs which ignite the fuel/air mixture in the cylinders. The magnetos allow the engine to run independently of the airplane's battery and electrical system. It is one of the redundancies built into the airplane for safety.
The ignition switch in the cockpit has five positions – off, right, left, both, and start. With the switch in the left or right position the engine is running on only one of the magnetos and only one set of spark plugs. When the switch is placed in the both position both magnetos are supplying ignition and all spark plugs are firing. During engine run-up you'll check both magnetos to be sure they're operating correctly.

### Rudder
Counteract the adverse yaw.
- Adverse Yaw: the airplane will initially yaw in the opposite direction of the bank

### Elevator Trim
Controlled by a trim wheel in the cockpit.

### Flap
Landing approach to be steeper and slower


### Gyro Vacuum System
Vacuum pump -> connect back to the engine. Low RPM, less vacuum.
Air filter
attitude indicator
heading indicator


## Category vs Class

*Category:*

(1) As used with respect to the certification, ratings, privileges, and limitations of airmen, means a broad classification of aircraft. Examples include: airplane; rotorcraft; glider; and lighter-than-air; and
(2) As used with respect to the certification of aircraft, means a grouping of aircraft based upon intended use or operating limitations. Examples include: transport, normal, utility, acrobatic, limited, restricted, and provisional.



*Class:*

(1) As used with respect to the certification, ratings, privileges, and limitations of airmen, means a classification of aircraft within a category having similar operating characteristics. Examples include: single engine; multiengine; land; water; gyroplane; helicopter; airship; and free balloon; and
(2) As used with respect to the certification of aircraft, means a broad grouping of aircraft having similar characteristics of propulsion, flight, or landing. Examples include: airplane; rotorcraft; glider; balloon; landplane; and seaplane.


- High Performance Airplane: Contains a piston engine rated over 200 horsepower (Cessna 182, Cirrus SR-22 and Beech Bonanza)
- Complex Airplane: includes a controllable-pitch propeller, retractable landing gear and wind flaps (Cessna 172RG, Piper Arrow, Beech Bonanza, Piper Malibu)

## Airspeed
- $S_0$: stalling speed or minimum steady flight speed in the landing configuration.
- $V_{NO}$: Upper limit of green arc (VNO)—the maximum structural cruising speed. Do not exceed this speed except in smooth air.
- $V_{NE}$: the never-exceed speed (never exceed airspeed).
- $V_A$: VA means design maneuvering speed.
- $V_{S1}$: means the stalling speed or the minimum steady flight speed obtained in a specific configuration.
- $V_{FE}$: VFE means maximum flap extended speed.
- $V_{FC}$: VFC/MFC means maximum speed for stability characteristics.
- $V_{LOF}$: VLOF means lift-off speed.
