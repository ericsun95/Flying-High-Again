## Category vs Class

*Category:*

(1) As used with respect to the certification, ratings, privileges, and limitations of airmen, means a broad classification of aircraft. Examples include: airplane; rotorcraft; glider; and lighter-than-air; and
(2) As used with respect to the certification of aircraft, means a grouping of aircraft based upon intended use or operating limitations. Examples include: transport, normal, utility, acrobatic, limited, restricted, and provisional.



*Class:*

(1) As used with respect to the certification, ratings, privileges, and limitations of airmen, means a classification of aircraft within a category having similar operating characteristics. Examples include: single engine; multiengine; land; water; gyroplane; helicopter; airship; and free balloon; and
(2) As used with respect to the certification of aircraft, means a broad grouping of aircraft having similar characteristics of propulsion, flight, or landing. Examples include: airplane; rotorcraft; glider; balloon; landplane; and seaplane.


## Airspeed
$S_0$: stalling speed or minimum steady flight speed in the landing configuration.
$V_{NO}$: Upper limit of green arc (VNO)â€”the maximum structural cruising speed. Do not exceed this speed except in smooth air.
$V_{NE}$: the never-exceed speed.
$V_A$: VA means design maneuvering speed.
