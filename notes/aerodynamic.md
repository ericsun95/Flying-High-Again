### Flying

#### Four Forces

Bernoulli's Principle: If the speed of a gas is increased, there will be a decrease in pressure

Primary Source of Lift: Results from decreased air pressure at the top of the wing
Secondary Source of Lift: Increased pressure from air striking the bottom of the wing (action, reaction, newton's third law)

#### Three Axis
- Longitudinal axis - roll/bank, head to tail, controlled by _ailerons_
- Lateral axis - pitch, two wings, controlled by _elevator_
- Vertical axis - yaw, controlled by _rudder_

vertical stabilizer & horizontal stabilizer like the feathers on the tail of an arrow to balance the wing and help keep
aircraft on a straight course



#### Four tendency to left

**Torque**, **spiraling slipstream**, **P-factor**, and **gyroscopic precession** are commonly referred to as the four left-turning tendencies, 
because they cause either the nose of the aircraft or the wings to rotate left.
