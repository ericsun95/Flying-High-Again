### Flying

#### Four Forces

Bernoulli's Principle: If the speed of a gas is increased, there will be a decrease in pressure

Primary Source of Lift: Results from decreased air pressure at the top of the wing
Secondary Source of Lift: Increased pressure from air striking the bottom of the wing (action, reaction, newton's third law)

#### Three Axis
- Longitudinal axis - roll/bank, head to tail, controlled by _ailerons_
- Lateral axis - pitch, two wings, controlled by _elevator_
- Vertical axis - yaw, controlled by _rudder_

vertical stabilizer & horizontal stabilizer like the feathers on the tail of an arrow to balance the wing and help keep
aircraft on a straight course



#### Four tendency to left

**Torque**, **spiraling slipstream**, **P-factor**, and **gyroscopic precession** are commonly referred to as the four left-turning tendencies, 
because they cause either the nose of the aircraft or the wings to rotate left.

Explain left turning tendencies. TGAS (PHAK 4-26)
- **Torque** – clockwise spinning prop causes airplane to roll left about the longitudinal axis. This is an example of Newton’s 3rd law.
On the ground, this left rolling tendency causes more weight to be on the left main gear thereby increasing the friction and inducing a left yawing tendency.
- **Gyroscopic Precession** – During a descent the tail rises and causes a force to felt on the top of the propeller. The resultant force is therefore 90 degrees ahead in the direction of the rotation (RIGHT SIDE of propeller) causing a left yawing tendency. This is mostly associated with tailwheel aircraft because on their takeoff roll the tail has to be raised and this creates a left turning tendency.
*This is otherwise a right turning tendency in a climb because the effective force would now be at the bottom of the propeller and thus the effective force would be on the LEFT SIDE. The other left turning tendencies, however, make this effect negligible.
- **Asymmetrical Thrust** – In a climb, the descending propeller blade (RIGHT SIDE) has a greater angle of attack and therefore creates more lift. This causes a left yawing tendency.
- **Spiraling Slipstream** – Propeller wash strikes the aircraft of the left side of the vertical stabilizer causing a left yawing tendency.
*The slipstream also strikes the right wing from above causing a right rolling tendency. The left rolling tendency from torque, however, makes this effect negligible.
All of these tendencies are more pronounced at low airspeeds, high angles of attack, and high power settings.
