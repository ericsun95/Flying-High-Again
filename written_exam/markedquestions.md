### Safety of Flight
#### Questions
- <span style="color:green"> Which of the substances below almost always negatively affect your flying performance? </span>
- Prescription analgesics.
Flying is almost always precluded while using prescription analgesics, such as drugs containing propoxyphene, oxycodone, meperidine, and codeine, since these drugs are known to cause side effects, such as mental confusion, dizziness, headaches, nausea, and vision problems.
- Other: Over-the-counter analgesics, such as acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), acetaminophen, and ibuprofen, have few side effects when taken in the correct dosage.Antibiotics. While many antibiotics are safe for use while flying, the infection requiring the antibiotic may prohibit flying.

- <span style="color:green"> What tool does crew resource management provide to flight crews? </span>
- The ability to recognize hazards and mitigate risks.
In the mid-1970s, airlines started to employ Crew Resource Management (CRM) in the workplace (flight deck). The program helped crews recognize hazards and provided tools for them to eliminate the hazard or minimize its impact.

- <span style="color:green"> What is the antidote when a pilot has a hazardous attitude, such as 'Macho'? </span>
- Taking chances is foolish.
Pilots who are always trying to prove that they are better than anyone else are thinking "I can do it - I'll show them." The antidote for this macho attitude is to say, "Taking chances is foolish."

- <span style="color:green"> What is the antidote when a pilot has a hazardous attitude, such as 'Resignation'? </span>
- I am not helpless.
Pilots who think "what's the use?" do not see themselves as being able to make a great deal of difference in what happens to them. The antidote to this resignation attitude is to say, "I'm not helpless. I can make a difference."


- <span style="color:green"> What is one of the neglected items when a pilot relies on short and long term memory for repetitive tasks? </span>
- Checklists.
A pilot must be aware of certain behavioral traps. Unjustified reliance on his short and long term memory, regular flying skills, or repetitive and familiar routes, may cause him to neglect proper flight planning, preflight inspections, and checklists.

- <span style="color:green"> What tool does crew resource management provide to flight crews? </span>
- The ability to recognize hazards and mitigate risks.
In the mid-1970s, airlines started to employ Crew Resource Management (CRM) in the workplace (flight deck). The program helped crews recognize hazards and provided tools for them to eliminate the hazard or minimize its impact.

- <span style="color:green"> Eye movements during daytime collision avoidance scanning should: </span>
- not exceed 10 degrees and view each sector at least 1 second.
Use a series of short, regularly spaced eye movements that bring successive areas of the sky into the central visual field. Each movement should not exceed 10° and each area should be observed for at least 1 second to enable detection.

- <span style="color:green"> What is it often called when a pilot pushes his or her capabilities and the aircraft's limits by trying to maintain visual contact with the terrain in low visibility and ceiling? </span>
- Scud running.
  Scud running is pushing the capabilities of the pilot and the aircraft to the limits by trying to maintain visual contact with the terrain while trying to avoid physical contact with it.


### Flight Control
- <span style="color:green"> To minimize the side loads placed on the landing gear during touchdown, the pilot should keep the </span>
- longitudinal axis of the aircraft parallel to the direction of its motion.
It is important that the touchdown of an aircraft occur with the aircraft's longitudinal axis parallel to the direction in which it is moving along the runway to reduce side loads on the landing gear.

> The upward pitch of the wings, called dihedral.
The upward angle formed by the wings is called dihedral. Dihedral contributes to roll stability.

### Aerodynamics of Stalls and Spins
- <span style="color:green"> A stall occurs when: </span>
- The smooth airflow over the wing becomes turbulent reducing lift.
An aircraft stall results from a rapid decrease in lift caused by the separation of airflow from the wing’s surface brought on by exceeding the critical AOA.
- <span style="color:green"> In what flight condition must an aircraft be placed in order to spin? </span>
- Stalled. A spin is an aggravated stall that results in autorotation. Without a stall, no spin will result. A spin is an aggravated stall that results in autorotation. Both wings must be stalled for a spin to occur.

### Aircraft Performance
- <span style="color:green"> Ground effect is most likely to result in which problem? </span>
- Becoming airborne before reaching recommended takeoff speed.
  When flown near the ground, the vertical component of airflow is restricted and modified. A wing operating in ground effect produces less drag and is more efficient. This can allow takeoff at slower than recommended speeds.


### Cross Country Flight
- <span style="color:green"> When converting from true course to magnetic heading, a pilot should </span>
- add westerly variation and subtract left wind correction angle.
Add west and subtract east variation. The memory device of "West is Best and East is Least" may help. A left wind angle is subtracted and a right wind angle is added. Visualizing or using a compass rose may help.

- <span style="color:green"> Which statement about longitude and latitude is true? </span>
- Lines of longitude cross the Equator at right angles.
  Meridians of longitude are drawn from the North Pole to the South Pole and are at right angles to the Equator.

- <span style="color:green"> (Refer to figure 51) What information should be entered in the Level field for Item 15 on the International Flight Plan form? </span>
- VFR cruising altitude.
  You should specify the VFR cruising altitude in the Level field for Item 15.


### Weather
#### Weather Theory
- <span style="color:green"> Which conditions result in the formation of frost? </span>
- The temperature of the collecting surface is at or below the dewpoint of the adjacent air and the dewpoint is below freezing.
Frost forms in much the same way as dew. The difference is that the collecting surface must be colder than the dew point of the surrounding air and the dew point must be colder than freezing.
- <span style="color:green"> What measurement can be used to determine the stability of the atmosphere? </span>
- Actual lapse rate. The difference between the existing lapse rate of a given mass of air and the adiabatic rates of cooling in upward moving air determines if the air is stable.
- <span style="color:green"> After takeoff you encounter a temperature inversion. You should expect: </span>
- Wind shear.
  Inversions commonly occur within the lowest few thousand feet above ground. Strong wind shears often occur across temperature inversion layers, which can generate turbulence.
- <span style="color:green"> The destination airport has one runway, 08-26, and the wind is calm. The normal approach in calm wind is a left hand pattern to runway 08. There is no other traffic at the airport. A thunderstorm about 6 miles west is beginning its mature stage, and rain is starting to reach the ground. The pilot decides to: </span>
- Fly an approach to runway 26 since any unexpected wind due to the storm will be westerly.
  Land on runway 26 since it is farthest from the storm and the winds are calm at the moment.
  Within approximately 15 minutes, the thunderstorm reaches the mature stage, which is the most violent time period of the thunderstorm’s life cycle. 
  A good rule of thumb is to circumnavigate thunderstorms identified as severe or giving an extreme radar echo by at least 20 nautical miles.

- <span style="color:green"> Clouds are divided into four families according to their </span>
- height range.
  The four basic cloud types are divided into four families, high, middle, low, and clouds with extensive vertical development.

- <span style="color:green"> The wind at 5,000 feet AGL is southwesterly while the surface wind is southerly. This difference in direction is primarily due to </span>
- friction between the wind and the surface.
In the northern hemisphere, Coriolis force deflects the pressure gradient force wind to the right until the wind blows approximately parallel to the isobars. Surface friction reduces this deflection so that a southwesterly wind becomes southerly.

- <span style="color:green"> A temperature inversion would most likely result in which weather condition? </span>
- An increase in temperature as altitude is increased.
  By definition, a temperature inversion is an increase in temperature as altitude is increased. The normal temperature "lapse rate" is inverted.

- <span style="color:green"> After takeoff you encounter a temperature inversion. You should expect: </span>
- Wind shear.
Inversions commonly occur within the lowest few thousand feet above ground. Strong wind shears often occur across temperature inversion layers, which can generate turbulence.

- <span style="color:green"> The most frequent type of ground or surface-based temperature inversion is that which is produced by </span>
- terrestrial radiation on a clear, relatively still night.
  The ground radiates and cools much faster than the overlying air. The air in contact with the ground becomes cold while the temperature a few hundred feet above changes very little. Thus, temperature increases with altitude.

#### Weather Briefing
- The outlook briefing will be provided when the proposed departure is 6 hours or more from the time of the briefing. (weather information for the following morning)
- A standard briefing is a comprehensive weather briefing. It includes all the necessary information the pilot needs to plan his flight. (Which type weather briefing should a pilot request, when departing within the hour, if no preliminary weather information has been received?)
- an abbreviated briefing.
An abbreviated briefing provides a supplement to disseminated data, an update to a previous briefing, or a briefing limited to specific information.

#### Weather Forecasts and Reports

A Pilot Report or PIREP is a report of the actual weather conditions as encountered by an aircraft in flight. Traditionally, these reports are transmitted by radio to an appropriate ground station for dissemination but, when necessary, they can be made by telephone after landing.

Inflight Aviation Weather Advisories (SIGMET, AIRMET, Convective SIGMET) are forecasts to advise en route aircraft of development of potentially hazardous weather. AIRMETs and SIGMETs provide information on icing.

![example](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gerardo-Flintsch/publication/268339229/figure/tbl9/AS:650779312525314@1532169287248/14-PIREP-Information-and-Codes.png)

1. [METAR vs TAR](https://pilotinstitute.com/metar-and-taf-reports/)
2. [METAR Abbreviation](https://www.weather.gov/media/wrh/mesowest/metar_decode_key.pdf)

- For determining general weather conditions on which to base flight planning.
The weather depiction chart gives a broad overview of the observed flying category conditions at the valid time of the chart.
[Weather Depiction Chart](https://pilotschoolhero.com/what-is-a-weather-depiction-chart/)

- <span style="color:green"> To determine the freezing level and areas of probable icing aloft, the pilot should refer to the </span>
- ** Inflight Aviation Weather Advisories. **
Inflight Aviation Weather Advisories (SIGMET, AIRMET, Convective SIGMET) are forecasts to advise en route aircraft of development of potentially hazardous weather. AIRMETs and SIGMETs provide information on icing.

- <span style="color:green"> What is indicated when a current CONVECTIVE SIGMET forecasts thunderstorms? </span>
- Thunderstorms obscured by massive cloud layers.
A Convective SIGMET contains data regarding severe thunderstorms, lines of thunderstorms, thunderstorms with wide spread heavy precipitation, and embedded thunderstorms. Embedded thunderstorms are those obscured by massive cloud layers.

- <span style="color:green"> When the term 'light and variable' is used in reference to a Winds Aloft Forecast, the coded group and windspeed is </span>
- 9900 and less than 5 knots.
  When the forecast speed is less than 5 knots, the coded group is "9900" and read, "LIGHT AND VARIABLE".

- <span style="color:green"> Which in-flight advisory would contain information on severe icing not associated with thunderstorms? </span>
- SIGMET. The SIGMET contains severe weather for all aircraft including severe icing.
- **Distraction** A Convective SIGMET implies severe or greater turbulence, severe icing, and low-level wind shear. These are only issued for severe thunderstorms, embedded thunderstorms, lines of thunderstorms, and thunderstorms with wide spread heavy precipitation.

- <span style="color:green"> What information is contained in a CONVECTIVE SIGMET? </span>
- Tornadoes, embedded thunderstorms, and hail 3/4 inch or greater in diameter.
  A Convective SIGMET contains data regarding severe thunderstorms including, tornadoes, and large hail, ¾" or more in diameter. Embedded thunderstorms are also forecast on Convective SIGMETs.
- **Distraction** Severe icing, severe turbulence, or widespread dust storms lowering visibility to less than 3 miles.
  Severe icing not associated with a thunderstorm, severe turbulence, and dust storms lowering visibility to less than 3 miles are forecast on SIGMETs, not Convective SIGMETs.

- <span style="color:green"> Absence of the sky condition and visibility on an ATIS broadcast indicates that </span>
- the ceiling is at least 5,000 feet and visibility is 5 miles or more.
  The ceiling/sky condition, visibility, and obstructions to vision may be omitted from the ATIS broadcast if the ceiling is above 5,000' and the visibility is more than 5 miles.


#### Hazardous weather
##### Questions
- <span style="color:green">A pilot can expect a wind-shear zone in a temperature inversion whenever the windspeed at 2,000 to 4,000 feet above the surface is at least</span>
- A shear zone is likely above an inversion if the wind at 2,000 to 4,000' is 25 knots or more.

- <span style="color:green"> Possible mountain wave turbulence could be anticipated when winds of 40 knots or greater blow </span>
- Across a mountain ridge, and the air is stable.
When stable air crosses a mountain barrier, mountain waves may occur. This creates a turbulent air mass which takes a wave-like pattern. This wave pattern may extend 100 miles or more downwind from the mountain.

- <span style="color:green"> How are Significant Weather Prognostic Charts best used by a pilot? </span>
- For determining areas to avoid (freezing levels and turbulence).
Fronts, precipitation, freezing levels, and turbulence found on the significant weather prognostic chart can provide the pilot with insight on areas to avoid. Looking at charts for multiple time periods allows the pilot to see how these areas will change. Prognostic charts are a forecast. They do not give current information.

- <span style="color:green"> Why is frost considered hazardous to flight? </span>
- Frost spoils the smooth flow of air over the wings, thereby decreasing lifting capability.
  The roughness of frost spoils the smooth flow of air over the airfoil causing a slowing of the air. This causes early airflow separation resulting in a loss of lift.

- <span style="color:green"> Upon encountering severe turbulence, which flight condition should the pilot attempt to maintain? </span>
- Level flight attitude.
  Maintain a constant attitude, let the aircraft "ride the waves".

- <span style="color:green"> The presence of ice pellets at the surface is evidence that there </span>
- is a temperature inversion with freezing rain at a higher altitude.
Rain falling through colder air may freeze during its descent falling as ice pellets. Ice pellets always indicate freezing rain at higher altitudes.


### Airport Operations

> Holding position markings for taxiway/taxiway intersections consist of a single dashed line extending across the width of the taxiway.

- <span style="color:green">While approaching to land on Runway 17 at an uncontrolled airport, you spot a lake on the east side of the airport which has ripples in the water at the southeastern edge. How should you proceed?</span>
- Check the windsock on the airfield to make the correct determination with runway choice. While the lake ripples may give you an idea of wind direction, it may not coincide with the wind direction on the field. It is always best to use the wind direction indicator directly on the field when determining the best runway to use.

### Systems
- <span style="color:green"> To properly purge water from the fuel system of an aircraft equipped with fuel tank sumps and a fuel strainer quick drain, it is necessary to drain fuel from the </span>
- fuel strainer drain and the fuel tank sumps.
If water shows up in any of the samples from the fuel tank drains, the fuel strainer drain, or other sump drains, they all must be drained until no more water is present in any of the samples to properly purge the water from the fuel system.

- <span style="color:green"> Position (navigation) lights on an aircraft are </span>
- Red for the left wingtip, green for the right wing tip, and white for the tail. Lights on an aircraft consist of a red light on the left wing, a green light on the right wing, and a white light on the tail.

- <span style="color:green"> Using a turn and slip indicator, how do you know that you are in a coordinated turn? </span>
- Centering the ball results in a coordinated turn.
  If inadequate right rudder is applied in a right turn, a slip results. Too much right rudder causes the aircraft to skid through the turn. Centering the ball results in a coordinated turn.

- <span style="color:green"> A precaution for the operation of an engine equipped with a constant-speed propeller is to </span>
- avoid high manifold pressure settings with low RPM.
  For any given RPM there is a manifold pressure that should not be exceeded. If manifold pressure is excessive for a given RPM, the pressure within the cylinders could be exceeded, placing undue stress on them. Follow the manufacturer's recommendations.

- <span style="color:green"> How is engine operation controlled on an engine equipped with a constant-speed propeller? </span>
- The throttle controls power output as registered on the manifold pressure gauge and the propeller control regulates engine RPM.
  On an engine equipped with a constant-speed propeller, throttle controls the power output registered on a manifold pressure gauge and the propeller control regulates the engine RPM.

###  Pitot-Static System
Altitude (All kinds of altitude) (TODO)

1. Pressure Altitude is the indicated altitude when an altimeter is set to 29.92 in Hg (1013 hPa in other parts of the world). It is primarily used in aircraft performance calculations and in high-altitude flight. Density Altitude is formally defined as “pressure altitude corrected for nonstandard temperature variations.”
2. When the altimeter is at sea level under standard conditions, indicated altitude and true altitude are equal.
3. True Altitude is height above mean sea level (MSL). Absolute Altitude is height above ground level (AGL).

> One inch of Hg is equal to approximately 1,000' of altitude. The difference between 29.15 and 29.85 is an increase of .70" Hg, or 700' of increased altitude indication.

#### Questions
- <span style="color:green"> How do variations in temperature affect the altimeter? </span>
- Pressure levels are raised on warm days and the indicated altitude is lower than true altitude.
On a warm day the atmosphere expands. An aircraft will actually be higher than the altimeter is indicating (higher pressure level). On a cold day the atmosphere contracts and an aircraft will be lower than the altimeter is indicating.

- <span style="color:green"> Under which condition will pressure altitude be equal to true altitude? </span>
- When standard atmospheric conditions exist.
True altitude is the actual altitude above mean sea level. Pressure altitude is the altitude in the standard atmosphere where pressure is the same as where you are. Pressure altitude is the same as true altitude in standard atmosphere.

- Indicated altitude is equal to pressure altitude when 29.92 is set in the Kohlsman window. This does not account for variations in conditions.

- <span style="color:green"> Which condition would cause the altimeter to indicate a lower altitude than true altitude? </span>
- Air temperature warmer than standard.
  When air is warmer than average, the aircraft is higher than the altimeter indicates. 
  Therefore, the altimeter will read lower than the aircraft's actual altitude. [Reference](https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/43473/how-will-the-altimeter-read-in-air-colder-than-isa)

### Powerplant

Be alert for carburetor icing if the temperature is between 20° F and 70° F with visible moisture or high humidity.

If an aircraft is equipped with a fixed-pitch propeller and a float-type carburetor, the first indication of carburetor ice would most likely be loss of RPM. The formation of ice in the carburetor reduces the amount of fuel reaching the engine. This causes a reduction of RPM.

- <span style="color:green"> A constant-speed propeller is more efficient than other propellers because: </span>
- It allows selection of the most efficient engine rpm for the given conditions.
A constant-speed propeller converts a high percentage of brake horsepower into thrust horsepower over a wide range of rpm and airspeed combinations.
Therefore, it is more efficient than other propellers.

- <span style="color:green"> You have been running an excessively rich mixture for some time now. As a result: </span>
- The spark plugs may become fouled.
  Excessively rich mixtures will cause additional carbon buildup on spark plugs, which may cause engine roughness.


- <span style="color:green"> During the run-up at a high-elevation airport, a pilot notes a slight engine roughness that is not affected by the magneto check but grows worse during the carburetor heat check. Under these circumstances, what would be the most logical initial action? </span>
- Check the results obtained with a leaner setting of the mixture.
  The aircraft is at a higher altitude airport, causing the proper ratio of fuel to air to be too rich (too much fuel for available air). By leaning out the fuel with the mixture control, the proper ratio will be attained and the roughness will smooth out.

### Aerodynamics of Stalls and Spins
- <span style="color:green"> During an approach to a stall, an increased load factor will cause the airplane to </span>
- stall at a higher airspeed.
An airplane's stalling speed increases in proportion to the square root of the load factor. A higher load factor raises the stall speed.

#### Questions
- <span style="color:green"> If the engine oil temperature and cylinder head temperature gauges have exceeded their normal operating range, the pilot may have been operating with </span>
- too much power and with the mixture set too lean.
High power settings with a lean mixture may lead to overheating. The additional fuel of a richer mixture has a cooling effect.
- **Distraction** The additional fuel of a richer mixture tends to have a cooling effect. High temperatures may lead to lower oil pressure as the oil loses viscosity with heat.

- <span style="color:green"> What change occurs in the fuel/air mixture when carburetor heat is applied? </span>
- The fuel/air mixture becomes richer.
Warm air is less dense than cold air. Applying carb heat will decreases air density causing a richer mixture (higher fuel to air ratio).

  ADS-B Out is only required for flights within the designated lateral and vertical boundaries up to 10,000' MSL of Class B, and C airspace, and Class E airspace above 10,000' MSL (excluding at or below 2,500' AGL) within the contiguous United States.


### Collision Avoidance

- <span style="color:green"> During a night flight, you observe a steady red light and a flashing red light ahead and at the same altitude. What is the general direction of movement of the other aircraft? </span>
- The other aircraft is crossing to the left.
  A steady red light is positioned on the left wing tip and a flashing red beacon light would be positioned such that it is visible in most directions. If these two lights are visible, the aircraft is crossing to the left.

### Radio Aids to Navigation
https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/80912/what-radial-is-the-aircraft-crossing

A radial is always pointing (radiating) away from the VOR. But your instrument shows the TO/FROM indicator as TO. So you are crossing a 210 course towards the VOR, which means you are on the 030 radial from the VOR.

- <span style="color:green"> If your GPS receiver is equipped with WAAS—Wide Area Augmentation System—your position accuracy is </span>
- Less than three meters.
  A differential global positioning system (DGPS) that improves the accuracy of the system. Traditional GPS is accurate to 15 meters. WAAS-enabled GPS accuracy is less than three meters 95 percent of the time.

- <span style="color:green"> When the course deviation indicator (CDI) needle is centered during an omnireceiver check using a VOR test signal (VOT), the omnibearing selector (OBS) and the TO/FROM indicator should read </span>
- 0° FROM or 180° TO, regardless of the pilot's position from the VOT.
  With the CDI centered, the OBS should read 0° with a FROM indication, or the OBS should read 180° with a TO indication.

- <span style="color:green"> A VOR test facility—VOT—transmits a: </span>
- 360 degree radial in all directions.
  The FAA VOR test facility (VOT) transmits a test signal, 360 degree radial, 
   in all directions which provides users a convenient means to determine the operational status and accuracy of a VOR receiver while on the ground where a VOT is located.

- <span style="color:green"> If Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) capability is lost in-flight, </span>
- The pilot has no assurance of the accuracy of the GPS position.
  Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) is the capability of a GPS receiver to perform integrity monitoring on itself by ensuring available satellite signals meet the integrity requirements for a given phase of flight. 
  Without RAIM, the pilot has no assurance of the GPS position integrity.

### Collision Avoidance
- <span style="color:green"> A near midair collision is defined as an incident associated with the operation of an aircraft in which a possibility of collision occurs as a result of coming less than what distance from another aircraft? </span>
- 500 feet
  According to the FAA, a near midair collision is defined as an incident associated with the operation of an aircraft in which a possibility of collision occurs as a result of proximity of less than 500 feet to another aircraft, or a report is received from a pilot or a flight crew member stating that a collision hazard existed between two or more aircraft.

### Basic Maths
- fuel -- 6 pounds (average consumption 8 gals/hr), when calculating the weight & moment, remember to use pound instead of the gallon
- fuel (std tanks) 38 gal
- As a rule of thumb, divide the difference between the temperature and dew point by 4.4 to determine the height of the cloud base. 82° F - 38° F = 44. 44 / 4.4 = 10 (in thousands of feet) or 10,000'.
- (Compass Heading: don't forget compass card): With a plotter, measure the true course from Claxton to Hampton as 44°. Use a flight computer to find the true heading of 40°. Add variation of 6°W. 40°+6° = 46°. Interpolate between -3° and -4° on compass card as -3.5. 46-3.5 = 42.5. Round to 43°.
