### Safety of Flight
#### Questions
- <span style="color:green"> Which of the substances below almost always negatively affect your flying performance? </span>
- Prescription analgesics.
Flying is almost always precluded while using prescription analgesics, such as drugs containing propoxyphene, oxycodone, meperidine, and codeine, since these drugs are known to cause side effects, such as mental confusion, dizziness, headaches, nausea, and vision problems.
- Other: Over-the-counter analgesics, such as acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), acetaminophen, and ibuprofen, have few side effects when taken in the correct dosage.Antibiotics. While many antibiotics are safe for use while flying, the infection requiring the antibiotic may prohibit flying.

- <span style="color:green"> What tool does crew resource management provide to flight crews? </span>
- The ability to recognize hazards and mitigate risks.
In the mid-1970s, airlines started to employ Crew Resource Management (CRM) in the workplace (flight deck). The program helped crews recognize hazards and provided tools for them to eliminate the hazard or minimize its impact.

- <span style="color:green"> What is the antidote when a pilot has a hazardous attitude, such as 'Macho'? </span>
- Taking chances is foolish.
Pilots who are always trying to prove that they are better than anyone else are thinking "I can do it - I'll show them." The antidote for this macho attitude is to say, "Taking chances is foolish."


### Flight Control
- <span style="color:green"> To minimize the side loads placed on the landing gear during touchdown, the pilot should keep the </span>
- longitudinal axis of the aircraft parallel to the direction of its motion.
It is important that the touchdown of an aircraft occur with the aircraft's longitudinal axis parallel to the direction in which it is moving along the runway to reduce side loads on the landing gear.



### Aerodynamics of Stalls and Spins
- <span style="color:green"> A stall occurs when: </span>
- The smooth airflow over the wing becomes turbulent reducing lift.
An aircraft stall results from a rapid decrease in lift caused by the separation of airflow from the wing’s surface brought on by exceeding the critical AOA.


### Cross Country Flight
- <span style="color:green"> When converting from true course to magnetic heading, a pilot should </span>
- add westerly variation and subtract left wind correction angle.
Add west and subtract east variation. The memory device of "West is Best and East is Least" may help. A left wind angle is subtracted and a right wind angle is added. Visualizing or using a compass rose may help.

### Weather
#### Weather Theory
- <span style="color:green"> Which conditions result in the formation of frost? </span>
- The temperature of the collecting surface is at or below the dewpoint of the adjacent air and the dewpoint is below freezing.
Frost forms in much the same way as dew. The difference is that the collecting surface must be colder than the dew point of the surrounding air and the dew point must be colder than freezing.

#### Weather Briefing
- The outlook briefing will be provided when the proposed departure is 6 hours or more from the time of the briefing. (weather information for the following morning)
- A standard briefing is a comprehensive weather briefing. It includes all the necessary information the pilot needs to plan his flight.
- an abbreviated briefing.
An abbreviated briefing provides a supplement to disseminated data, an update to a previous briefing, or a briefing limited to specific information.

#### Weather Forecasts and Reports

A Pilot Report or PIREP is a report of the actual weather conditions as encountered by an aircraft in flight. Traditionally, these reports are transmitted by radio to an appropriate ground station for dissemination but, when necessary, they can be made by telephone after landing.

- <span style="color:green"> What is indicated when a current CONVECTIVE SIGMET forecasts thunderstorms? </span>
- Thunderstorms obscured by massive cloud layers.
A Convective SIGMET contains data regarding severe thunderstorms, lines of thunderstorms, thunderstorms with wide spread heavy precipitation, and embedded thunderstorms. Embedded thunderstorms are those obscured by massive cloud layers.

#### Hazardous weather
##### Questions
- <span style="color:green">A pilot can expect a wind-shear zone in a temperature inversion whenever the windspeed at 2,000 to 4,000 feet above the surface is at least</span>
- A shear zone is likely above an inversion if the wind at 2,000 to 4,000' is 25 knots or more.

- <span style="color:green"> Possible mountain wave turbulence could be anticipated when winds of 40 knots or greater blow </span>
- Across a mountain ridge, and the air is stable.
When stable air crosses a mountain barrier, mountain waves may occur. This creates a turbulent air mass which takes a wave-like pattern. This wave pattern may extend 100 miles or more downwind from the mountain.

- <span style="color:green"> How are Significant Weather Prognostic Charts best used by a pilot? </span>
- For determining areas to avoid (freezing levels and turbulence).
Fronts, precipitation, freezing levels, and turbulence found on the significant weather prognostic chart can provide the pilot with insight on areas to avoid. Looking at charts for multiple time periods allows the pilot to see how these areas will change. Prognostic charts are a forecast. They do not give current information.


### Airport Operations

- <span style="color:green">While approaching to land on Runway 17 at an uncontrolled airport, you spot a lake on the east side of the airport which has ripples in the water at the southeastern edge. How should you proceed?</span>

- Check the windsock on the airfield to make the correct determination with runway choice. While the lake ripples may give you an idea of wind direction, it may not coincide with the wind direction on the field. It is always best to use the wind direction indicator directly on the field when determining the best runway to use.

- <span style="color:green"> A lighted heliport may be identified by a
 </span>

- green, yellow, and white rotating beacon.
The beacon colors for a lighted heliport are green, yellow, and white. The total number of flashes is 30 to 45 per minute.

#### Questions
- <span style="color:green"> If the aircraft's radio fails, what is the recommended procedure when landing at a controlled airport? </span>
- Observe the traffic flow, enter the pattern, and look for a light signal from the tower.
If the transmitter and receiver are inoperative, determine the direction of traffic flow, join the pattern, and maintain visual contact with the tower.
- Important: What should we do if the radio failed?

- <span style="color:green"> A near midair collision is defined as an incident associated with the operation of an aircraft in which a possibility of collision occurs as a result of coming less than what distance from another aircraft? </span>
- 500 feet
According to the FAA, a near midair collision is defined as an incident associated with the operation of an aircraft in which a possibility of collision occurs as a result of proximity of less than 500 feet to another aircraft, or a report is received from a pilot or a flight crew member stating that a collision hazard existed between two or more aircraft.
- <span style="color:green"> If instructed by ground control to taxi to Runway 9, the pilot may proceed </span>
- to the next intersecting runway where further clearance is required.
Pilots are required to hold short of all runways intersecting their route. Specific clearance is required to enter or cross all runways.

- <span style="color:green"> When squawking the VFR code (1200) on your transponder, what is the minimum mode the transponder must be in? </span>
- Mode A. The basic transponder is classified as Mode A. If you have Mode C it is best to use it because it substantially increases the capability of surveillance systems to see your aircraft.


### Magnetic Compass
- <span style="color:green">In the Northern Hemisphere, the magnetic compass will normally indicate a turn toward the south when</span>
- the aircraft is decelerated while on a west heading.
Acceleration / deceleration error is most pronounced on a heading of east or west. **ANDS, Accelerate, North, Decelerate, South**.

- <span style="color:green">Some nontowered airports have a Remote Communications Outlet (RCO) enabling you to:</span>
- Contact ATC over the VOR.
Many FSSs are equipped with Remote Communications Outlets (RCOs) and can transmit on the same frequency at more than one location. The frequencies available at specific locations are indicated on charts above FSS communications boxes. [7 Rare Symbols Found On VFR Sectional Charts](https://www.boldmethod.com/blog/lists/2022/06/seven-rare-symbols-found-on-vfr-sectional-charts/)

- <span style="color:green"> On a turn from south: </span>
- The compass exaggerates the rate of turn.
When starting a turn from a southerly heading, the compass leads the turn or exaggerates the rate of turn.
- **Distraction** When starting a turn from a northerly heading, the compass lags behind the turn.
- **Distraction** As the heading passes through east or west, the compass will momentarily have the correct heading while turning.

### Systems
- <span style="color:green"> To properly purge water from the fuel system of an aircraft equipped with fuel tank sumps and a fuel strainer quick drain, it is necessary to drain fuel from the </span>
- fuel strainer drain and the fuel tank sumps.
If water shows up in any of the samples from the fuel tank drains, the fuel strainer drain, or other sump drains, they all must be drained until no more water is present in any of the samples to properly purge the water from the fuel system.

- <span style="color:green"> Position (navigation) lights on an aircraft are </span>
- Red for the left wingtip, green for the right wing tip, and white for the tail. Lights on an aircraft consist of a red light on the left wing, a green light on the right wing, and a white light on the tail.

###  Pitot-Static System
Altitude (All kinds of altitude) (TODO)

Pressure Altitude is the indicated altitude when an altimeter is set to 29.92 in Hg (1013 hPa in other parts of the world). It is primarily used in aircraft performance calculations and in high-altitude flight. Density Altitude is formally defined as “pressure altitude corrected for nonstandard temperature variations.”

True Altitude is height above mean sea level (MSL). Absolute Altitude is height above ground level (AGL).

> One inch of Hg is equal to approximately 1,000' of altitude. The difference between 29.15 and 29.85 is an increase of .70" Hg, or 700' of increased altitude indication.

#### Questions
- <span style="color:green"> How do variations in temperature affect the altimeter? </span>
- Pressure levels are raised on warm days and the indicated altitude is lower than true altitude.
On a warm day the atmosphere expands. An aircraft will actually be higher than the altimeter is indicating (higher pressure level). On a cold day the atmosphere contracts and an aircraft will be lower than the altimeter is indicating.

- <span style="color:green"> Under which condition will pressure altitude be equal to true altitude? </span>
- When standard atmospheric conditions exist.
True altitude is the actual altitude above mean sea level. Pressure altitude is the altitude in the standard atmosphere where pressure is the same as where you are. Pressure altitude is the same as true altitude in standard atmosphere.

- Indicated altitude is equal to pressure altitude when 29.92 is set in the Kohlsman window. This does not account for variations in conditions.


### Powerplant

Be alert for carburetor icing if the temperature is between 20° F and 70° F with visible moisture or high humidity.

If an aircraft is equipped with a fixed-pitch propeller and a float-type carburetor, the first indication of carburetor ice would most likely be loss of RPM. The formation of ice in the carburetor reduces the amount of fuel reaching the engine. This causes a reduction of RPM.

### Aerodynamics of Stalls and Spins
- <span style="color:green"> During an approach to a stall, an increased load factor will cause the airplane to </span>
- stall at a higher airspeed.
An airplane's stalling speed increases in proportion to the square root of the load factor. A higher load factor raises the stall speed.





#### Questions
- <span style="color:green"> If the engine oil temperature and cylinder head temperature gauges have exceeded their normal operating range, the pilot may have been operating with </span>
- too much power and with the mixture set too lean.
High power settings with a lean mixture may lead to overheating. The additional fuel of a richer mixture has a cooling effect.
- **Distraction** The additional fuel of a richer mixture tends to have a cooling effect. High temperatures may lead to lower oil pressure as the oil loses viscosity with heat.

- <span style="color:green"> What change occurs in the fuel/air mixture when carburetor heat is applied? </span>
- The fuel/air mixture becomes richer.
Warm air is less dense than cold air. Applying carb heat will decreases air density causing a richer mixture (higher fuel to air ratio).

### Airport Operations
A runway/runway hold position sign is located at the holding position on runways that intersect other runways.


### Basic Maths
- fuel -- 6 pounds (average consumption 8 gals/hr)
- As a rule of thumb, divide the difference between the temperature and dew point by 4.4 to determine the height of the cloud base. 82° F - 38° F = 44. 44 / 4.4 = 10 (in thousands of feet) or 10,000'.
