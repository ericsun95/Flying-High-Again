### LogBook

#### 08/07/2022 (XC flight from KMQY to KBWG)
##### Maneuvering
- Soft field take off: after 500 ft above the ground, remember to go through the climb checklist, especially remember to adjust flaps back (soft field
  take off comes with 10 flaps)

##### XC Flight  
- When planning cross country, remember to measure the distances between checkpoints, for each checkpoint, remember to have several close checkpoints (highway, railway) so that we can make sure we are right on track
- For flight following, "attitude your discussion", means you will decide your attitude and tell the controller
- For flight following, when reaching your last checkpoint, consider getting the weather (20 miles to the final destination), prepare the frequency, go over
the descend checklist and start descending. You should flying with the same attitude into the pattern instead of descending into the pattern.

##### Landing
- When approaching with high speed low attitude, try to reduce the power without changing the pitch attitude to avoid the fast speed lost. The goal is to avoid
too much pitch and thrust change in the final.
- Avoid porpoise landing (very dangerous)
