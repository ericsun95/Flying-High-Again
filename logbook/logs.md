## 10/09/2022 （Prepare CheckRide - Maneuver）
- Practice all the maneuvers again
- Remember to use the checklist
- Emergency landing, turn to runway directly
- Power off stall: level off directly, throttle, 1 nope of flap

## 10/01/2022 （Prepare CheckRide - Maneuver）
- Practice all the maneuvers again, land in the bumpy wind (15-18 head wind)
- remember to use the checkride (emergency descent checklist)


## 09/23/2022 （Prepare CheckRide - Maneuver）

- Power on Stall, power off stall
- Soft field take off should not stop (short field take off stops)
- Clear on the landing runway
- Need more practice to find the surrounding traffic


## 09/17/2022 （XC Solo Flight MQY -> 2M2 -> BGF -> MQY）
Finally, I get all the time required for checkride.

Needs more practice on landing and traffic pattern (avoid too close to the runway)
- When ask for flight following, also mention the type of aircraft (cessna)
- Similar call sign frequency 24KK and 32KK

## 09/16/2022 （Maneuvering）
Needs more detailed retro on basic maneuvering.

Emergency descent when one wing got fire:

1. Power all the way to idle, nodes down
2. Bank 30 degrees to the other direction
3. speed close to 125 knots
4. when close to 2500 feet, level off


## 09/07/2022 （Night Flight）
Night flight which attempts to land in BNA.
Failed at getting approval from nashville airspace C.

Night flight is super challenging especially when
you fly at a low attitude. It needs more practice to 
find the airport and other aircraft.


## 09/06/2022 (Written Test)

Took the written test in nashville flight training office.
The test is very similar to what sporty training offers.

## 08/28/2022 （Solo XC from KMQY to 2M2）
Second solo xc flight from KMQY to 2M2. Pick a new airport just to
challenge myself.

- Try to spot and locate the airport at least 5 miles away
- Practice radio communication (there are some misunderstandings when close to the final destination)
- Landing: again, don't pull too much when aircraft flares, small adjustment

## 08/27/2022 （Solo XC from KMQY to KBGF）
First solo xc flight in my life. It's not only a milestone for flight learning. 
Being suffered from all kinds of things throughout
the whole year, finally, see some hope in front. Got lost for very long time, the flying seems
back on track.

Solo is quite different from flying with the instructor. I was chill and relax when flying
with someone else since I am pretty sure he can correct any mistakes I made. Even
though I have flown this route multiple times. I am almost 100% focused on where am I, how's the surrounding traffic, etc.
Always relying on yourself, be the pilot in command.


Lessons:
- **Engine oil should be at least 5** Good to check and find it was 4 and add enough before flight
- Go through checklists all the time to avoid missing action items
  - always check lights, carburetor heat, mixture
- A good traffic pattern is better than small adjustment
- Prepare the radio frequency before flying, double check with the traffic control
  - **radar contact**: it means the traffic center indent you
- For soft field take off, flare at around 35 knots, push the nose little forward
- Call for weather briefing

## 08/19/2022 (Landing Practice + Solo in KMQY)
Practice several times Soft field landing and Short field landing
- Soft field landing - land as soft as possible
  - Approach To Landing: as you get close to touchdown, you want to hold the aircraft 1-2 feet off the runway in ground effect
  - Approach To Landing: As you enter ground effect, it's OK to use a **small amount of power** to level off and make sure you touch down as slow as possible
  - Touchdown: After your main wheels touch down gently, you want to slowly remove power, if you had any in, and hold the nose wheel off the runway.
  - Rollout: Since your main gear are much stronger than the nose wheel, you want to keep the nose off the soft/rough surface until your plane has slowed down to a safer speed. By maintaining back pressure on the yoke, you can hold the nose off until you've reached that safer speed. Your nose wheel will thank you.

- Short field landing - land as short as possible (hit the 100 footprint mark)
  - Approach To Landing: in complete control of your airspeed and descent rate. When you're stabilized, on speed, and on glide path
  - Touchdown: slowly start reducing your throttle to idle
  - As you approach your touchdown point, keep reducing power and start flaring. Your goal is to touch down on your point at the minimum controllable airspeed, which is just above stall speed.
  - Rollout: Once you touchdown, you want to use maximum aerodynamic braking. After you touch down, slowly start pulling back on the yoke, being careful not to lift back off.
    - Be gentle as you apply the brakes, then start increasing braking pressure to slow down.

Notes on Solo:
- Try to do full stop taxi back each time so that you can practice more on take off.


## 08/14/2022 (XC flight from KMQY to KGZS)
- Remember to use the checklist after take off and before descend
- After take off and transition to Nashville airspace, the control asked me
about my true course heading. Inform them the true course heading
- Memphis center is 128.15, they will also give you the altimeter
- Inform them when traffic insight, prepare to descend earlier to avoid Nashville
Airspace

- First attempt to use the VOR for navigation. VOR navigation step 1 is to
Ident the VOR frequency, then change the navigation from GPS to VOR
- Volume: Always check the volume to avoid miscommunications
- Short Field Take Off: hold breaks at the very beginning


## 08/13/2022 (Flight Training)
- Practice Soft Field Landing and Soft field Take off, short trip to Lebanon.
- Soft Field Landing: land as soft as possible
- Soft Field Take Off: 10 flaps, nodes up all the way, noses down to flare after taking off, after reaching Vy, nose up again
- For landing at the final, try to keep a constant speed, when close the landmark, keep rpm around 1200 (pull the throttle all the way back), use the runway end as the checkpoint, when it moves up, slight pull the nose to align with it, let it flare a little bit and then you can pull it back progressively and land the aircraft.


## 08/07/2022 (XC flight from KMQY to KBWG)
### Maneuvering
- Soft field take off: after 500 ft above the ground, remember to go through the climb checklist, especially remember to adjust flaps back (soft field
  take off comes with 10 flaps)

### XC Flight  
- When planning cross country, remember to measure the distances between checkpoints, for each checkpoint, remember to have several close checkpoints (highway, railway) so that we can make sure we are right on track
- For flight following, "attitude your discussion", means you will decide your attitude and tell the controller
- For flight following, when reaching your last checkpoint, consider getting the weather (20 miles to the final destination), prepare the frequency, go over
the descend checklist and start descending. You should flying with the same attitude into the pattern instead of descending into the pattern.
- For flight following, ATC clearance: "Altitude your discretion"
[Reference](https://flighttrainingcentral.com/2020/06/vfr-flight-following-a-pilots-guide/)

### Landing
- When approaching with high speed low attitude, try to reduce the power without changing the pitch attitude to avoid the fast speed lost. The goal is to avoid
too much pitch and thrust change in the final.
- Avoid porpoise landing (very dangerous)

## 08/06/2022 (Maneuvering Practice)
### Maneuvering
#### Maneuvering checklist
Before all the Maneuverings, go through the following checklist:

- Mixture full rich
- All lights on
- Pick a field
- Radio call to inform the position
- Cleaning turns

#### Slow flight
- Determine the slow flight speed: +10knots of the beginning of the stall horn

#### Power off Stall
- Call out cues (at which stage: stall horn, etc)
- After setting up for stall, first push the nose down to monic landing situation
