## 08/14/2022 (XC flight from KMQY to KGZS)
- Remember to use the checklist after take off and before descend
- After take off and transition to Nashville airspace, the control asked me
about my true course heading. Inform them the true course heading
- Memphis center is 128.15, they will also give you the altimeter
- Inform them when traffic insight, prepare to descend earlier to avoid Nashville
Airspace

- First attempt to use the VOR for navigation. VOR navigation step 1 is to
Ident the VOR frequency, then change the navigation from GPS to VOR
- Volume: Always check the volume to avoid miscommunications
- Short Field Take Off: hold breaks at the very beginning


## 08/13/2022 (Flight Training)
- Practice Soft Field Landing and Soft field Take off, short trip to Lebanon.
- Soft Field Landing: land as soft as possible
- Soft Field Take Off: 10 flaps, nodes up all the way, noses down to flare after taking off, after reaching Vy, nose up again
- For landing at the final, try to keep a constant speed, when close the landmark, keep rpm around 1200 (pull the throttle all the way back), use the runway end as the checkpoint, when it moves up, slight pull the nose to align with it, let it flare a little bit and then you can pull it back progressively and land the aircraft.


## 08/07/2022 (XC flight from KMQY to KBWG)
### Maneuvering
- Soft field take off: after 500 ft above the ground, remember to go through the climb checklist, especially remember to adjust flaps back (soft field
  take off comes with 10 flaps)

### XC Flight  
- When planning cross country, remember to measure the distances between checkpoints, for each checkpoint, remember to have several close checkpoints (highway, railway) so that we can make sure we are right on track
- For flight following, "attitude your discussion", means you will decide your attitude and tell the controller
- For flight following, when reaching your last checkpoint, consider getting the weather (20 miles to the final destination), prepare the frequency, go over
the descend checklist and start descending. You should flying with the same attitude into the pattern instead of descending into the pattern.
- For flight following, ATC clearance: "Altitude your discretion"

### Landing
- When approaching with high speed low attitude, try to reduce the power without changing the pitch attitude to avoid the fast speed lost. The goal is to avoid
too much pitch and thrust change in the final.
- Avoid porpoise landing (very dangerous)

## 08/06/2022 (Maneuvering Practice)
### Maneuvering
#### Maneuvering checklist
Before all the Maneuverings, go through the following checklist:

- Mixture full rich
- All lights on
- Pick a field
- Radio call to inform the position
- Cleaning turns

#### Slow flight
- Determine the slow flight speed: +10knots of the beginning of the stall horn

#### Power off Stall
- Call out cues (at which stage: stall horn, etc)
- After setting up for stall, first push the nose down to monic landing situation
