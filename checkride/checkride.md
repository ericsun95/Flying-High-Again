### Maneuver

#### Power on Stall (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf-1bGziMME)
- Select an altitude where recovery will occur no lower than 1500' AGL
- Commence a clearing turn
- While maintaining heading, reduce power, adjusting pitch (trim) to maintain altitude 
- establish the takeoff/departure configuration, set power to no less than 65% available power
- Apply take off power after reaching rotating speed (Vr), high pitch altitude
- stalling (call out), right rudder
- relax back pressure, node down to recover, full throttle, maintain Vy to build airspeed and climb to specified airspeed
- cruise checklist


####  slipping & skidding

What is the difference between slipping turns and skidding turns? 
In slipping turns the nose of the aircraft is yawed towards the outside of a turn.
In skidding turns the nose of the aircraft is yawed towards the inside of a turn.


#### Power off Stall (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IdWyxnadSg)
- Select an altitude where recovery will occur no lower than 1500' AGL
- Commence a clearing turn
- slow the airplane and add flaps
- below white arc + 10 flaps
- below 75 + 20 flaps (?)
- below 65 + 40 flaps, throttle all the way back
- descent 
- stalling (call out), rudder
- nose down, recover the flaps progressively
- maintain Vy to build airspeed and climb to specified airspeed
- cruise checklist


#### Steep turn (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fJyjBLIG68)

Coordinated 360 degrees turn

- Select an altitude where recovery will occur no lower than 1500' AGL
- base altitude + 95knots + 100 -200 rpm
- Commence a clearing turn, pick a heading with heading bug
- little throttle, bank 45 degrees, reference altitude indicator
- pick a visual reference, opposite aileron - avoid overbanking, little rudder, simply change of the bank, airspeed -+10 knots
- neutralize 20-25 degrees before
- power back the original setting
- cruise checklist


#### Slow flight
Slow flight needs to find the stall hole first
