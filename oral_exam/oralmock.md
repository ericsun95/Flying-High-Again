  1. TRSA (grey circle line, terminal radar service)
  2. State line
  3. How tall are all class C airspace? MSL or AGL? 
     - Class C airspace is generally airspace from the surface to 4,000 feet above the airport elevation (charted in MSL) surrounding those airports that have an operational control tower, are serviced by a radar approach control, and have a certain number of IFR operations or passenger enplanements.
  4. What does the C mean beside a frequency (at symrna)
     - CTAF: https://cessnachick.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/howtoreadasectionalchart1.pdf
  5. What does the magenta ring around most non-towered airports mean? Instrument approaches
  6. Know atlanta's airspace. How to get into airports near atlanta without contacting Atlanta ATC
  7. Special use airspaces (warning, prohibited, alert, MOA) There's 7 in total, which needs permission, which doesn't
  8. Can you go into Knoxville Class C at 2 miles visibility? SVFR?
  9. Can I request SVFR at night? ??
  10. What should you do if visibility becomes 2 miles away from an airport? 
      - Descend to G
  11. What is 122.95 at Smyrna? Unicom
  12. Numbers on lake ... Elevation
- **METARs and TAFs** (phrased it as current and forecasted weather)
- **Runway incursions**: people, aircraft, cars showing up at the places they should show up
- **If the tower is too busy to tell you where to exit after the landing, where do you get off at?**
  - closest runway
- **How long does it take for your eyes to adjust to night?**
  - between 20 and 30 minutes
- **When do you use position lights for night flying?**
  - Position lights. Landing lights are not only useful for taxi, takeoffs, and landings, but also provide a means by which airplanes can be seen at night by other pilots. 
  - Pilots are encouraged to turn on their landing lights when operating within 10 miles of an airport and below 10,000 feet.
- **What side of the plane are the green and red lights on**
  - The red light should be on the airplane's left wing and the green light, on the right.
- **How far do you fly from a thunderstorm?**
  - 20 miles
- **Hypoxia and carbon monoxide poisoning**
  - 4 types
- **How does CO poisoning happen? Effects?**
- **Where do I get my weather?**
- **Beacons colors, runway light color, taxiway light color, where to find them?**
- **2 types of checklists: read and do, do and verify**
- **Is Zulu time the same everywhere? Asked what is 9 am cst in Zulu**
- **Supplemental oxygen requirement**
  - 12500, 14000, 15000
- **Currency Requirements**
  - biennial flight review
- **How to recover from a stall?**
  - PARE 
- **Asked about wake turbulence, where to fly when a jet is landing in front of you**
  - Wake turbulence is a function of an aircraft producing lift, resulting in the formation of two counter-rotating vortices trailing behind the aircraft.
  - By flying your airplane above their flight path, and landing beyond their touchdown point
- **Where to find the TAS numbers?**
  - POH in performance
- VFRs headings (0-179 odd thousand + 500 ... 180-259 even thousand + 500) based on magnetic heading of track
- **What are airworthiness directive and who issues it**
  - Airworthiness Directives ( ADs ) are legally enforceable rules issued by the FAA in accordance with 14 CFR part 39 to correct an unsafe condition in a product.
  - We issue three types of ADs: Notice of Proposed Rulemaking ( NPRM ), followed by a Final Rule. Final Rule; Request for Comments. Emergency ADs
- **What are different types of NOTAMs (4 types)**
  - A NOTAM is a notice containing information essential to personnel concerned with flight operations but not known far enough in advance to be publicized by other means.
- **Anti-ice vs de-ice and examples**
  - Anti-icing equipment is turned on before entering icing conditions and is designed to prevent ice from forming. 
  - Deicing equipment is designed to remove ice after it begins to accumulate on the airframe.
  - Pitot heat is an anti-ice system standard on many aircraft. The pitot heat uses electricity to heat the pitot tube. This prevents the pitot tube from icing over.
  - Carb heat is both an anti-ice and a de-ice system. By pre-heating air before it enters the carburetor and preventing ice formation, it is an anti-ice system. By melting ice that has already accumulated inside the carburetor, it is a de-ice system.
- **Alcohol ... how many hours before you fly**
- **When is the beacon used? Whenever the plane is running**
- **Tach vs Hobbs**
  - Hobbs time increases as the clock moves forward. Tach time, on the other hand, moves faster or slower depending on engine RPM. So for example, while taxiing, tach time is only about 40% of Hobbs time.
- **IAS, TAS, CAS, GS**
  - IAS: Indicated airspeed 
  - TAS: True airspeed: CAS corrected by temperature, how fast it go through the air
  - CAS: Calibrated airspeed: IAS corrected for instrument error
  - GS: Ground speed
- **How to determine the altitude?**
  - magnetic course (91.159)
  - Ture course -> Magnetic course -> Altitude -> True heading -> -+dev -> Magnetic course
- **Diversion**
- **What needs type rating?** 
  - weight 12500 lbs
  - if horsepower is 200 limit, need endorsement
- ADIZ (airspace defense identification zone, needs flight plan)
- static port: airspeed indicator(inaccurate), altimeter(no data), vertical speed indicator (no data)
- pitot tube
- **What is in the pitot tube?**
  - aneriod wafe
